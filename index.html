      <h2>What is Gestalt Therapy?</h2>
      <p>
        Gestalt therapy is a humanistic, client-centered approach that emphasizes present-moment awareness, personal
        responsibility, and the therapeutic relationship.
        It helps individuals explore their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in the here and now to gain deeper
        self-understanding and promote personal growth.

      <h2>What is Somatic Experiencing?</h2>
      <p>
        Somatic Experiencing® is a body-based therapeutic approach developed by Dr. Peter Levine. It is designed to help
        people resolve trauma, chronic stress, and overwhelm by gently
        guiding attention to internal sensations and supporting the body's natural ability to regulate and heal. Rather
        than retelling traumatic events, SE helps restore balance through
        attuned physical awareness, movement, and pacing.

    <section id="practice" class="section">
      <h2>Deirdre's Practice</h2>
      <p>
        Deirdre’s therapeutic approach is integrative and body-centered, drawing on Somatic Experiencing®, Gestalt
        therapy, mindfulness, and Transforming Touch® work. She supports clients in reconnecting with their natural
        capacity for resilience, safety, and emotional regulation—especially in the face of trauma, stress, or life
        transitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her work gently invites awareness of the body, the present moment, and relational patterns, allowing people to
        process difficult experiences at their own pace. By combining the nervous system focus of Somatic Experiencing,
        the embodied presence of mindfulness, and the relational depth of Gestalt, Deirdre creates a grounded space
        where healing and reconnection can unfold naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
        She offers sessions online and in person, welcoming both individuals new to therapeutic work and those
        continuing an existing journey.
